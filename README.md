# AssaultCube Cheat - Aimbot & ESP

This is my first game hacking project, a cheat for *AssaultCube* version 1.3.0.2, written in **C++**. It includes an **aimbot** and **ESP** (Extra-Sensory Perception) using an overlay with **ImGui**.

## Features
- **Aimbot**: Automatically aims at enemy heads when the right mouse button is pressed. This functionality adjusts the crosshair to target the head based on the opponentâ€™s position.
- **ESP (Extra-Sensory Perception)**: Displays enemy positions on the screen. The positions are marked as points or objects, making it easier to spot opponents.

## Technical Details
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Overlay**: Built using **DirectX** and **ImGui** for rendering visual elements on the screen.
- **Game**: *AssaultCube* (version 1.3.0.2)
- **Core Features**:
  - **Aimbot**: Uses opponent positions to aim at their heads when activated.
  - **ESP**: Provides a clear visual representation of enemy positions on the screen.
  
### Performance Focus
- **Multi-threading**: The cheat is designed to be lightweight and responsive, utilizing **multi-threading** to maximize performance. This approach ensures that different processes (such as aimbot and ESP) run concurrently, improving responsiveness and minimizing lag.
  
- **Future Plans**: I plan to integrate a **kernel driver** for read and write memory access, which will further optimize the cheat's performance and stability.

## Project Status
This project is ongoing, with the current focus on **stability** and **functional completeness**. The planned completion date is **December 16, 2024**.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash

## How To use Notes: 
If you ever get stuck when opening menu press the right mouse button and your good to go :)
